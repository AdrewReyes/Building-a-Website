            What's so great about combining the worlds of coding and cuisine? 
            Dev Dish was founded by two passionate developers who turned their 
            love for software into a culinary adventure. After years of coding 
            by day and cooking by night, they decided to merge their two passions 
            and create something extraordinary.

            Dev Dish is the brainchild of Alex and Jamie, two friends who met at a 
            hackathon and discovered a shared love for innovative cuisine. With a 
            background in software development and a knack for culinary creativity, 
            they embarked on a journey to deliver delicious, tech-themed dishes to 
            the community.
